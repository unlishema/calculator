# Calculator for RuneScape via Alt1

**A fast, lightweight Alt1 calculator designed specifically for RuneScape players Ideal for quick math, skilling calculations, and in-game number crunching without ever leaving the game window.**

## Features
- **Always-on-top Alt1 window** for seamless use while playing RuneScape.

- **Full basic calculator functionality** (add, subtract, multiply, divide).
- **Keyboard and on-screen button input** for flexible use during gameplay.
- **Shiftable window size** with DPI/tile scaling compatibility.
- **Instant evaluation** for fast math during combat, skilling, or banking.

## Why Use This?
RuneScape often requires quick math decisions:
- XP/hour projections  
- Resource calculations  
- Profit margins  
- Damage range math

Instead of alt-tabbing or using your phone, the calculator stays inside Alt1 as a floating widget—keeping you focused on the game.
